here we dicuss how actually js works
{} is must ,global Execution context
1.Global Execution context(imp)
2.Function/Functional Execution context(imp)
3.Eval Execution Context(not so important)

JS code execute in two phase(memory creation phase or creation phase,Execution phase)

in the first phase only and only memory is allocated..all other things are done on second phase

let val1=1
let val2=2
function add(a,b){
    let total=a+b
    return total
}
let result1 = add(val1,val2)
let result2 = add(10,4)

The very First is Global exe phase then first phase is MCP and variable get memory allocated and all variable get undefined
**Very First {} GEC*

*1.Memory Phase*
        val1->undefined
        val2->undefined
        add->defination
        result1->undefined
        result2->undefined

*First cycle complete and always ececuted*
*2.Execution phase*

        val1<-1
        val1<-2
        result1<-add<-
                {
                    again a new GEC is created with a new variable enviorment and ececution thread
                    *1.Memory Phase*
                        val1->undefined
                        val2->undefined
                        total->undefined
                    *2.Execution Phase*
                        num1->10
                        num2->5
                        total->15
                        //now this retrun value is return to global execution context means to the most and very first GEC
                    *Last*
                        this GEC(actually second GEC) will be deleted the control shifted to first GEC(parent)


                }
        result2<-add<-
        
                    now again a new GEC is created with a NVE and ececution thread
                    *1.Memory Phase*
                        val1->undefined
                        val2->undefined
                        total->undefined
                    *2.Execution Phase*
                        num1->10
                        num2->5
                        total->15
                        //now this retrun value is return to global execution context means to the most and very first GEC
                    *Last*
                        this GEC(actually third GEC) will be deleted the control shifted to first GEC(parent)


                }


This keeps on working and simply working of a basic function in JS


====================================

What is call Stack->execution is work in a stack manner as a programming basic as usual. This work in LIFO concept
